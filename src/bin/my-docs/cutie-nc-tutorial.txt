tutorial: cutie-nc is an interactive executable. 
usage: 
{special commands} (a blank){ the content should input }
now only four commands support: 
help : content needn't, for display this page. 
(nothing but then a blank): read the content and send to the server (with the '\n' you input. )
file : read the content, then open the related file. read the bytes from specific file and send to the server. (without the extra '\n' )
connect : connect the the server, with ipv4 & tcp protocol. 
    example: 
    - connect 192 168 0 1 25535: connect the host (192.168.0.1:25535). 
connect2 : connect to the server, similar to 'connect', but just directly use the dot split format. 
    example: 
    - connect2 192.168.0.1:25535: connect the host ... 
uconnect : connect to the server, with udp protocol. 
    example: 
    - uconnect localhost:80 : connect the host (localhost:80)
exit: exit the program.
